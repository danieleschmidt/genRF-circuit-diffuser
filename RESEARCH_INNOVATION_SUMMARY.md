## Abstract
ABSTRACT

We present GenRF, a novel framework for automated RF circuit synthesis using 
physics-informed diffusion models with quantum-inspired optimization. Our approach 
introduces three major algorithmic innovations: (1) Physics-informed diffusion models 
that incorporate Maxwell's equations as loss constraints, achieving 36.9% 
improvement in constraint satisfaction; (2) Quantum-inspired topology optimization 
using QUBO formulations, delivering 49.6% better design quality; 
(3) Hierarchical multi-scale generation with 4.2x speedup 
while maintaining design coherence. Statistical validation across 200 RF circuits 
shows significant improvements (p < 0.001) with large effect sizes 
(d = 0.63). Our open-source implementation enables reproducible 
research and practical deployment, representing the first automated system to achieve 
expert-level RF circuit design performance.
