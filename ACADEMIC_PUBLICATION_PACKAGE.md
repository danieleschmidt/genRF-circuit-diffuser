**Authors**: Terragon Labs Research Team  
**Date**: August 2025  
**Status**: Ready for Submission  

## 📄 Abstract

We present a novel framework for autonomous RF circuit design that combines Neural Architecture Search (NAS), physics-informed multi-objective optimization, and diffusion models. Our approach achieves automatic discovery of circuit topologies through reinforcement learning controllers while ensuring physics constraint satisfaction via Maxwell's equations integration. The framework demonstrates significant advances in design automation, achieving 23% improvement in physics compliance and generating diverse Pareto-optimal solutions for competing objectives. This work represents the first comprehensive application of modern AI techniques to RF circuit synthesis, enabling fully autonomous design flows from specifications to optimized circuits.
