# genRF-circuit-diffuser
genRF-circuit-diffuser revolutionizes analog and RF circuit design through generative AI. Based on the July 2025 paper introducing cycle-consistent GANs for robust RF synthesis, this toolkit combines diffusion models with SPICE simulation to automatically generate optimal circuit topologies and parameters.
