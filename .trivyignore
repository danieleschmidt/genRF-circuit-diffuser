# Trivy ignore file for vulnerability scanning
# Use this file to ignore specific vulnerabilities that are:
# 1. False positives
# 2. Accepted risks with documented justification
# 3. Waiting for upstream fixes

# Example format:
# CVE-2021-1234  # Justification: False positive for our use case
# CVE-2021-5678  # Justification: Accepted risk - low impact, no fix available

# ML/AI Framework specific ignores
# Many ML libraries have known vulnerabilities in dependencies that don't affect our use case

# PyTorch related - ignore development/testing related vulnerabilities
# that don't affect production model inference
# CVE-YYYY-XXXX  # PyTorch dev dependency vulnerability - not used in production

# NumPy/SciPy - ignore vulnerabilities in optional dependencies
# CVE-YYYY-XXXX  # NumPy optional dependency - not used in our workflow

# Matplotlib - ignore GUI-related vulnerabilities as we use headless rendering
# CVE-YYYY-XXXX  # Matplotlib GUI backend - not used in production

# SPICE Integration - ignore simulation-only vulnerabilities
# CVE-YYYY-XXXX  # PySpice simulation environment - sandboxed execution

# Note: This file should be regularly reviewed and updated
# All ignored CVEs should have documented justifications
# Consider fixing or upgrading instead of ignoring when possible
