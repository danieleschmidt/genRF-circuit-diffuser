# ADR-0001: AI Model Architecture Selection

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The GenRF Circuit Diffuser requires a robust AI architecture capable of generating both circuit topologies and optimizing component parameters. The challenge is designing a system that can:

1. Generate realistic circuit topologies that are manufacturable
2. Optimize component values for specific performance targets
3. Integrate with SPICE simulation for validation
4. Scale to multiple circuit types and technologies

## Decision
We will implement a hybrid approach using:

1. **Cycle-Consistent GANs for Topology Generation**
   - Generator creates circuit netlists from specifications
   - Discriminator validates realistic circuit structures
   - Cycle consistency ensures topology-specification alignment

2. **Denoising Diffusion Models for Parameter Optimization**
   - Conditional diffusion based on topology and specifications
   - Iterative refinement process guided by SPICE feedback
   - Supports multi-objective optimization constraints

3. **Bayesian Optimization for Global Search**
   - Efficient exploration of design space
   - Uncertainty quantification for robust designs
   - Pareto front optimization for conflicting objectives

## Consequences

### Positive
- Topology generation ensures manufacturable designs
- Parameter diffusion provides fine-grained control
- Bayesian optimization efficiently explores large spaces
- Modular architecture allows independent model improvement
- SPICE integration ensures physical validity

### Negative
- Complex training pipeline requiring multiple models
- Higher computational requirements during generation
- Model coordination complexity increases maintenance burden
- Requires large datasets for each circuit type

## Alternatives Considered

### Single End-to-End Model
- **Pros**: Simpler architecture, single training process
- **Cons**: Limited control over topology vs parameters, harder to debug

### Reinforcement Learning Approach
- **Pros**: Natural fit for iterative design optimization
- **Cons**: Sample inefficiency, difficulty with multi-objective rewards

### Transformer-Based Generation
- **Pros**: Strong sequence modeling capabilities
- **Cons**: Limited understanding of circuit physics, harder SPICE integration
