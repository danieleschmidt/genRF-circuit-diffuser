# Manual Setup Requirements

This document outlines the manual setup steps that need to be completed after the automated SDLC implementation due to GitHub App permission limitations.

## Overview

The automated SDLC implementation has successfully created all necessary files, configurations, and documentation. However, some GitHub-specific configurations require manual setup due to permission restrictions.

## Required Manual Actions

### 1. GitHub Workflows Creation

**Priority: HIGH**

The workflow templates are available in `docs/workflows/examples/`. These need to be manually copied to `.github/workflows/`:

```bash
# Create workflows directory
mkdir -p .github/workflows

# Copy workflow templates
cp docs/workflows/examples/ci-template.yml .github/workflows/ci.yml
cp docs/workflows/examples/security.yml .github/workflows/security.yml
cp docs/workflows/examples/docs.yml .github/workflows/docs.yml
cp docs/workflows/examples/release.yml .github/workflows/release.yml
cp docs/workflows/examples/benchmark.yml .github/workflows/benchmark.yml
```

**Required Workflows:**
- `ci.yml` - Continuous integration and testing
- `security.yml` - Security scanning and vulnerability detection
- `docs.yml` - Documentation building and deployment
- `release.yml` - Automated release and publishing
- `benchmark.yml` - Performance benchmarking

### 2. Repository Settings Configuration

**Priority: HIGH**

#### Branch Protection Rules

Configure branch protection for `main` branch:

1. Go to Settings → Branches
2. Add rule for `main` branch:
   - ✅ Require pull request reviews before merging
   - ✅ Require status checks to pass before merging
   - ✅ Require branches to be up to date before merging
   - ✅ Include administrators
   - ✅ Allow force pushes (for maintainers only)

**Required Status Checks:**
- `CI / test (3.8)`
- `CI / test (3.9)`
- `CI / test (3.10)`
- `CI / test (3.11)`
- `Security / analyze`
- `Documentation / build`

#### Repository Topics

Add the following topics to improve discoverability:
