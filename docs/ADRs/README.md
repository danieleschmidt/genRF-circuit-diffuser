# Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains Architectural Decision Records (ADRs) for the GenRF Circuit Diffuser project. ADRs document important architectural decisions, their context, and rationale.

## What are ADRs?

Architectural Decision Records are lightweight documents that capture important architectural decisions along with their context and consequences. They help teams understand why certain decisions were made and provide a historical record of the system's evolution.

## ADR Format

We use the following template for our ADRs:

```markdown
# ADR-XXXX: [Title]

## Status
[Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded]

## Context
[Description of the issue motivating this decision]

## Decision
[The decision that was made]

## Consequences
[What happens as a result of this decision]

## Alternatives Considered
[Other options that were evaluated]

## References
[Links to relevant documents, discussions, or research]
```

## Current ADRs

| ADR | Title | Status | Date |
|-----|-------|--------|------|
| [ADR-0001](ADR-0001-ML-Framework-Selection.md) | ML Framework Selection (PyTorch vs TensorFlow) | Accepted | 2025-01-31 |
| [ADR-0002](ADR-0002-SPICE-Engine-Architecture.md) | SPICE Engine Architecture Pattern | Accepted | 2025-01-31 |
| [ADR-0003](ADR-0003-Data-Storage-Strategy.md) | Data Storage Strategy | Accepted | 2025-01-31 |
| [ADR-0004](ADR-0004-API-Design-Principles.md) | API Design Principles | Accepted | 2025-01-31 |
| [ADR-0005](ADR-0005-Security-Architecture.md) | Security Architecture Approach | Accepted | 2025-01-31 |

## Creating New ADRs

When making significant architectural decisions:

1. Create a new ADR file using the next sequential number
2. Use the template above
3. Discuss the ADR with the team
4. Once consensus is reached, mark as "Accepted"
5. Update this README with the new ADR

## ADR Lifecycle

- **Proposed**: Initial draft, under discussion
- **Accepted**: Decision has been made and approved
- **Deprecated**: Decision is no longer relevant
- **Superseded**: Replaced by a newer ADR

## Guidelines

### When to Create an ADR

Create an ADR for decisions that:
- Affect system architecture or design patterns
- Have long-term impact on the codebase
- Involve trade-offs between different approaches
- Require significant time or resources to change later
- Set precedents for future similar decisions

### When NOT to Create an ADR

Don't create ADRs for:
- Implementation details that don't affect architecture
- Temporary or easily reversible decisions
- Decisions with obvious solutions
- Purely administrative decisions

## Review Process

1. **Draft**: Author creates initial ADR
2. **Review**: Team reviews and provides feedback
3. **Discussion**: Address concerns and iterate
4. **Decision**: Team consensus on approach
5. **Approval**: Technical lead or architect approves
6. **Implementation**: Begin implementing the decision

## Tools and Resources

- **ADR Tools**: [adr-tools](https://github.com/npryce/adr-tools) for command-line management
- **Templates**: Use the template above for consistency
- **References**: Link to relevant documentation, research, or discussions

## Best Practices

1. **Be Concise**: Keep ADRs focused and readable
2. **Include Context**: Explain why the decision was needed
3. **Document Alternatives**: Show what options were considered
4. **Update Status**: Keep status current as decisions evolve
5. **Link Related ADRs**: Reference related decisions
6. **Version Control**: Track changes to ADRs over time

## Examples of Good ADRs

### Technical Decisions
- Choosing between different ML frameworks
- Selecting database technologies
- Defining API standards
- Setting security policies

### Process Decisions
- Development workflow choices
- Testing strategies
- Deployment approaches
- Monitoring and observability standards
